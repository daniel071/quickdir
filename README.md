# quickdir
## quickdir is a simple tool to easily change directories within the shell

## Installation
### *NIX  (Linux, macOS, BSD)
Simply run this installation script:
```bash
sudo bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniel071/quickdir/master/src/install.sh)
```

### Windows
I have not tested this with Windows, but it probably will work with [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

## Usage
```shell
$ quickdir add projectOne
Alias added

$ quickdir remove projectOne
Alias removed

$ quickdir list
# Work in progress - will list all added aliases in the future!
```
